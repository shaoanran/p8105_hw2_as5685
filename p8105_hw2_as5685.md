# problem 1

## import datasets

``` r
waterwheel_data =
  read_excel(path = "~/Desktop/Data Science/p8105_hw2_as5685/Trash-wheel-collection-totals-8-6-19.xlsx","Mr. Trash Wheel", range = ("A2:N408")) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
  )
```

## Clean precipitation data for 2017 and 2018

``` r
precipitation2017_data =
  read_excel(path = "~/Desktop/Data Science/p8105_hw2_as5685/Trash-wheel-collection-totals-8-6-19.xlsx","2017 Precipitation", range = "A2:B14") %>%
    janitor::clean_names() %>%
    drop_na() %>% 
    mutate(year = "2017")
    
precipitation2018_data =
  read_excel(path = "~/Desktop/Data Science/p8105_hw2_as5685/Trash-wheel-collection-totals-8-6-19.xlsx","2018 Precipitation", range = "A2:B14") %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>%
    drop_na() %>% 
    mutate(year = "2018")


PrecipitationsCombined_data =
bind_rows(precipitation2017_data, precipitation2018_data) %>% 
  mutate(
    month = month.name[month]
  )
```

Interpretation about the data: The total precipitation in 2018 is 70.33.
The median number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2017 is 8. The number
of observation in waterwheel\_data is 344. The number of observation in
merged data for `precipitation2018_data` and `precipitation2017_data` is
24. In the dataset “PrecipitationsCombined\_data”, the colomn “total” is
key variable which shows the total precipitation in each month of each
year. Such as total precipitation is 2.34 inches in January 2017. This
variables is related to the some variables in dataset
“waterwheel\_data”, such as “dumpsters”. If the total precipitation
is large, then usually, the total number of dumpster filled will also be
increased. So we can explore the relationship between
them.

## Read in and Tidy Fivethirtyeight

    names_prefix = "prez_",
    values_to = "value"
  ) %>%

  pivot_longer(

## Merge 2017,2018 and unemployment

``` r
merged_data =
  left_join(pols_month_data,snp_data,by = c("year","month"))
merged_three_data = 
  left_join(merged_data, unemployment_data, by = c("year","month"))
```

Interpretation: In `snp_data`, it contains the values of GDP in the
correspondent months during the range of year (1950, 2015). In
`pols_month`, it contains the number of national politicians who are
democratic or republican each month during the range of year (1947,
2015). In `unemployment_data`, it contains the `unemployment_percentage`
each month during the range of year (1948, 2015). Before merging,
variable `mon`for date is separated into `year` and `month`, so
`merged_data` contains the `year` and `month`, and all other colomns
from either `snp_data` or `pols_month_data`. After merging
`unemployment_data` into the two combined datasets, the
`merged_three_data` contains all of the variables of `snp_data`,
`pols_month_data` and `unemployment_data`between 1947 and 2015. The key
variables include `close`,`president` taking values `prez_gop` and
`prez_dem`, `unemployment_percentage` and some varaibles for the number
of senators as well as representors. It is easier to look for the
associaton between different variables. The dimensions of `snp_data`,
`pols_month_data` and `unemployment_data` are (787, 3),(822, 10), (816,
3).
